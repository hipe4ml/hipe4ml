    "\n",
    "The goal of this tutorial is to provide an example of binary classification with machine learing techniques using the package [hipe4ml](https://hipe4ml.github.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is based on the measurement of the invariant mass of the $\\mathrm{D^{+}}$ meson, through its three-body decay channel $\\mathrm{D^{+}} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{K^{-}} + \\pi^+ + \\pi^+$, in the transverse-momentum interval $2 \\leq p_{\\mathrm{T}} < 3$ GeV/$c$. The data were collected by ALICE in 2010 and correspond to 240 million minimum-bias pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV. In this data sample about 4.7 million $\\mathrm{D^{+}}$ candidates have been reconstructed. For training and testing the algorithm, a Monte Carlo simulated data sample with about 4 thousand true $\\mathrm{D^{+}}$ mesons is used.\n",
